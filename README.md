**Detecting Sarcasm in News Headlines and Articles using Deep Learning**

Detecting sarcasm in news headlines and articles is crucial for several reasons. Sarcasm occurs
when someone says something but means the opposite, often with a humorous or critical tone.
This can easily confuse readers, especially when vocal cues and body language are absent in
written text. If sarcasm is not recognized, it can lead to misunderstandings and the spread of false
information. For instance, a sarcastic headline about a political figure might make readers believe
something that isn’t true, influencing public perception and opinion. This issue becomes even
more significant when we consider automated systems like news aggregation platforms and social
media algorithms. These systems rely on natural language processing (NLP) to curate and
recommend content. If these systems fail to detect sarcasm, they might spread misleading or outof-context information, exacerbating the spread of false news.
Furthermore, not all readers may recognize sarcasm, leading to varying interpretations of the
same content. This can polarize audiences based on their understanding or misunderstanding of
the sarcasm. Effective sarcasm detection is also essential for accurate sentiment analysis, which
is used to assess public opinion and moderate content online. If sarcasm is not detected, sentiment
analysis can be flawed, leading to incorrect insights and ineffective content moderation.
Goals:
1. Build a model that can recognize sarcastic text.
2. Improve the accuracy of identifying sarcasm.
3. Make sure our model can tell the difference between positive/negative and
sarcastic/non- sarcastic sentiments.
Solution Overview: To solve this problem, we will use deep learning, a type of artificial
intelligence, to teach the computer how to recognize sarcasm in text. The solution involves
several steps.

Steps to Implement:

1. Data Collection and Preparation:
○ Collect Data: Gather text examples that are labeled as sarcastic or not sarcastic
from sources like social media.
○ Clean Data: Remove unnecessary parts of the text, like links or special characters.
○ Tokenize Text: Break down the text into individual words or pieces.
○ Remove Stop Words: Get rid of common words that don't add much meaning, like
"and" or "the".
○ Lemmatize/Stemming: Reduce words to their base form.

2. Feature Extraction:
○ Word Embeddings: Use tools like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT to convert
words into numerical values that represent their meanings.
○ Sentiment Features: Extract additional information, like the overall sentiment
of the text and grammatical tags

3. Model Design:
○ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Use models like LSTM or GRU to
understand the order of words in the text.
○ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Use models to detect local patterns in the
text.
○ Transformer Models: Use advanced models like BERT to understand the
context and meaning of the text.
○ Ensemble Model: Combine different models to get better results.

4. Training and Evaluation:
○ Train the Model: Use labeled data to teach the model how to recognize sarcasm.
○ Evaluate the Model: Test the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and
recall to see how well it works.

Additional Steps:
• Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust model settings to improve performance.
• Cross-Validation: Use different parts of the data to ensure the model works well on
various samples.

Timeline:
• Week 1-2: Collect and prepare the data. Develop a simple initial model.
• Week 3-4: Experiment with different word embeddings and fine-tune the model.
• Week 5-6: Create an ensemble model and tune hyperparameters.
• Week 7-8: Finalize the model and prepare the documentation and presentation.

Evaluation Criteria:
• Accuracy: How often the model is correct.
• Precision: How well the model identifies sarcastic content correctly.
• Stability: How consistent the model is across different datasets.
• Predictive Power: How well the model can work with new, unseen data.
